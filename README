After a security update of a library one needs to restart all programs that
make use of this library in order for the security update to become effective.
whatmaps takes a package name and looks (on Linux systems) in /proc/pid/maps
for processes that map shared objects contained in a certain package. It then
looks for the corresponding processes to find the services that need to be
restarted.

It currently supports Debian and Fedora but might also work well on other
Debian or RPM based distributions.

Usage
=====
Pass the names of the packages that had shared objects updated:

    whatmaps <pkg1> <pkg2>

The example output looks like:

    # whatmaps libssl0.9.8
    WARNING: No service script found in 'wpasupplicant' for '['/sbin/wpa_supplicant']' - restart manually
    Services that possibly need to be restarted:
    postfix
    libvirt-bin
    ntpd

Apt Integration
===============

To enable automatic restarts during security updates on Debian based systems set:

    Whatmaps::Enable-Restart "1";

in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20services.
