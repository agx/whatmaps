Description: tool to find processes mapping shared objects
 After package upgrades (especially security fixes), services using a
 shared library need to be restarted to make use of the updated version.
 .
 Whatmaps looks for shared objects provided by upgraded packages, lists any
 running processes that map them, and can integrate with APT to restart
 services as needed after security upgrades.
