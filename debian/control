Description: Find processes mapping shared objects
 After package upgrades processes using a ahared library need to be
 restarted to make use of that updated library (e.g. if the library got a
 security upgrade).
 .
 Whatmaps looks for shared objects in packages and finds running programs that
 map them, list them and allows one to restart them.
 .
 It can be integrated with apt to automatically restart services automatically
 on security upgrades.
