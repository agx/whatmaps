_Description: Automatically restart services after shared library security updates?
 Services need to be restarted to benefit from updates of shared libraries they
 depend on. Without that they remain vulnerable to security bugs fixed in these
 updates.
 .
 Automatic service restarts are only done if apt fetched the library from a
 source providing security updates. This also affects packages installed
 via unattended-upgrades.
