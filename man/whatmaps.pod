whatmaps - Find and restart services after library upgrades

=head1 SYNOPSIS
=encoding utf8

B<whatmaps> [--restart] [--print-cmds=I<FILE>] pkg1 [pkg2 pkg3 ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<whatmaps> tries to find a list of services that need to be restarted
after a library upgrade because they map that particular library into
their address space. It does this by extracting a list of shared
objects from the packages given on the command line. It then looks at
the list of running processes to find those that map the shared
objects and uses the distributions package manager to find out the
packages that ship them. It then prints a list of services in these
packages that likely need to be restarted.

By default it assumes all services in the found packages need a restart but it
also keeps a internal distribution specific list of exceptions.

If the I<--restart> option is given, the services are restarted without any
prompting and with the I<--prind-cmds> option the restart commands are written to
a file for later execution.

On Debian systems B<whatmaps> can also be run automatically by apt-get. See
L<//usr/share/doc/whatmaps/README> for details.
